Currently, most behaviours of the robots are based on rules that the teams invent themselves, such as shooting the ball if the robot is at a certain distance to the ball (Lagrand et al., 2016) (RÂ¨ofer et al., 2016). Reinforcement Learning uses rewards obtained from the environment to learn actions that can be taken, resulting in an action policy that is learnt from own experiences. For example, Reinforcement Learning has been used for learning to play games like Pong (Mnih et al., 2015), where only the pixels of a game state were used as input environment and the obtained score as reward. Since Reinforcement Learning learns from experiences, we experiment with it, using minimal reward set-ups to learn a robot to score a penalty.
