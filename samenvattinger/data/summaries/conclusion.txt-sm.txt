With no goalkeeper defending the goal, walking the ball into the goal is the most successful behaviour for scoring. However, having the goal and the goalkeeper in different bins seems to be more useful, since the goalkeeper is defending the goal. If the robot knows the difference between the positions of the goal and the goalkeeper, the robot can learn to kick past the goalkeeper into the goal. Besides, the state space of the robot can be reduced to only that part the robot can observe (Figure 18), to ensure that it is more realistic to a real robot, and simpler to extend to a real robot.
