For example, a Reinforcement Learning algorithm to automatically learn a controller for helicopters is applied by Ng et al. In Mnih et al. For example, in Smart and Kaelbling (2002) Reinforcement Learning was applied to learn control policies for mobile robots. Q-learning (Watkins, 1989) was used in order to learn a robot two tasks, which are Corridor Following and Obstacle Avoidance.
