 President Trump boasted Tuesday on Twitter about his ability to write. He said he uppercases certain words for “emphasis” — not because they should, in fact, be capitalized. Why are we talking about capitalization? When should I use capitalization? Most people know that you should capitalize the first word in a sentence, the pronoun “I” and proper nouns. Ms. Stamper said it is a common mistake to universally apply capitalization to words such as “earth” and “moon.” Personal titles should be lowercase, except before someone’s name, she said.
